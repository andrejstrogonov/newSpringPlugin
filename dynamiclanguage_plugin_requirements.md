# Functional Requirements for DynamicLanguage Library Plugin

## Overview
The `dynamiclanguage` library plugin is designed to integrate seamlessly with IntelliJ IDEA, providing comprehensive support for a new dynamic programming language. This document outlines the functional requirements necessary for the plugin's development and future enhancements.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Code Editing
- **Syntax Highlighting**: The plugin must provide syntax highlighting for the dynamic language to improve code readability and ease of use.
- **Code Completion**: Offer context-aware code suggestions as the user types, enhancing productivity and code accuracy.

### 2. Project Management
- **Project Wizard**: Include a project setup wizard to assist users in creating new projects using the dynamic language.
- **Dependency Management**: Integrate with popular build tools (e.g., Maven, Gradle) to manage library dependencies.

### 3. Debugging
- **Breakpoint Management**: Allow users to set breakpoints within the code editor for debugging.
- **Variable Inspection**: Enable variable inspection during debugging to aid developers in understanding the program flow.

### 4. Language-Specific Features
- **Interpreter/REPL Integration**: Provide a built-in interpreter or REPL for immediate code execution and testing.
- **Code Refactoring**: Support basic refactoring capabilities such as renaming, inlining, and extraction tailored to the dynamic language.

### 5. Testing
- **Unit Testing Support**: Enable configuration and execution of unit tests, and display results in a user-friendly format.

### 6. Code Analysis
- **Static Analysis Tools**: Incorporate static code analysis to identify potential issues and code improvements.
  
### 7. Documentation
- **Inline Documentation Generation**: Assist users in creating inline documentation comments, similar to Javadoc or Sphinx for Python.

### 8. User Interface
- **Preferences/Settings Page**: Provide a settings page for users to configure language-specific options and plugin behavior.

### 9. Community and Extensibility
- **Plugin Updates**: Ensure the plugin can be easily updated through IntelliJ IDEA's plugin manager.
- **Community Contributions**: Allow extension points for broader community involvement and the addition of custom features.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The plugin should load quickly and execute tasks without noticeable lag.
- **Usability**: Aim for an intuitive user experience that aligns with IntelliJ IDEA's design principles.
- **Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA and support across major operating systems.

By adhering to these functional requirements, the `dynamiclanguage` library plugin should fulfill the essential features expected by developers, facilitating seamless development and integration with IntelliJ IDEA.
